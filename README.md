# Error Localization and Relevance Analysis
The most tedious task in a programmer’s routine is to spend time on debugging and to determine the cause of the error. Debugging can be made much more simpler if we can determine automatically what program segments are actually responsible for the error. This is called “Fault Localization”.
Fault Localization encompasses the task of identification of the program statements that are relevant for the error trace and determining the variables whose values should be tracked in order to understand the cause of the error.
